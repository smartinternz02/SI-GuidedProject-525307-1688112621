Network Traffic Analysis - Protocols

#Overview

Network traffic analysis involves the examination of data packets exchanged over a network,
allowing for insights into network performance, security, and troubleshooting. Key protocols,
such as HTTPs for secure web browsing, ICMP for network diagnostics, vsftpd for FTP file transfers, 
TCP/IP for reliable data transmission, and UDP for faster but less reliable communication, play crucial roles. 
Analysis of these protocols helps identify potential vulnerabilities, detect anomalies, and optimize network efficiency. 
By understanding the characteristics and behaviors of these protocols, network administrators can enhance network performance 
and ensure a secure and reliable communication environment.

#Proposed solution The proposed solution is a comprehensive network traffic analysis tool that combines automated monitoring 
with detailed protocol analysis. This tool will provide real-time insights into network traffic, allowing administrators to
detect anomalies, troubleshoot issues, and optimize performance effectively.
